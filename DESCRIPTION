Description: 
    This package provides data access to counts matrices and meta-data for single-cell RNA sequencing data of 
    thymic epithlial cells across mouse ageing using SMARTseq2 and 10X Genommics chemistries. Access is provided 
    as a data package via ExperimentHub. It is designed to facilitate the re-use of data from Baran-Gale _et al._ 
    in a consistent format that includes relevant and informative meta-data.
